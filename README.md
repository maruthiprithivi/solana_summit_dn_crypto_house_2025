# ClickHouse for Solana Analytics Demo

> 🚀 Transform hours of blockchain queries into milliseconds with ClickHouse

This repository contains demo queries and documentation for showcasing ClickHouse's capabilities for Solana blockchain analytics at the Solana Summit APAC 2025, Da Nang, Vietnam.

## 📊 The Challenge

Solana processes up to **65,000 transactions per second**, generating approximately **400GB of data daily**. Traditional databases struggle with:

- ❌ Hour-long query times
- ❌ Expensive infrastructure costs
- ❌ Inability to handle real-time analytics
- ❌ Complex nested data structures

## 💡 The Solution: ClickHouse

ClickHouse is a columnar database designed for real-time analytics on massive datasets. For blockchain data, it provides:

- ✅ **100-1000x faster queries** than PostgreSQL
- ✅ **10-20x data compression**
- ✅ **5-10x lower infrastructure costs**
- ✅ **Sub-second query performance** on billions of rows

## 🎯 Demo Overview

This demo showcases 10 progressive queries that solve real Solana ecosystem challenges:

### Query Highlights

1. **Scale Overview** - Analyze billions of transactions instantly
2. **Network Health** - Real-time success rates and performance metrics
3. **Program Analytics** - Identify top programs and their compute efficiency
4. **Token Velocity** - Track token movements and liquidity patterns
5. **Whale Watching** - Detect large transfers as they happen
6. **Money Flow** - Understand value movement through the network
7. **Instant Dashboards** - Pre-aggregated views for zero-latency analytics
8. **Compute Optimization** - Profile program performance
9. **Congestion Analysis** - Identify network bottlenecks

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Based on real implementations:

- Query time: **100ms - 2s** (vs 30min - 2hrs in PostgreSQL)
- Data ingestion: **1M+ rows/second** per node
- Compression ratio: **15-20x** for Solana data
- Cost reduction: **80-90%** vs traditional data warehouses

## 💬 Common Questions

**Q: How real-time is the data?**
A: Sub-second ingestion latency. Queries see data within 1-2 seconds of block production.

**Q: Can it scale with Solana's growth?**
A: Yes, ClickHouse scales linearly. Add nodes for more performance.

**Q: What's the learning curve?**
A: If you know SQL, you can use ClickHouse. Advanced features are optional.
